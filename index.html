  <h1> My Computer Science Website </h1>
  <p> This site will host Computer Science projects. I created this site using HTML and CSS. 
This site was created in the spring of 2017 as a project for my Computer Science class. The purpose of this
site is to apply what I have learned about HTML and CSS in an authentic way.
Check out my projects page to see other projects I created in this class. My
hobbies page and other page contain a little bit more about me as well as
show off some more of what I learned during this CS Unit.
